# RTOS_corporative
/* This RTOS was by Apaar Mishra under the guidance of Dr. Jason Losh for the course EE 6314 in University of Texas at Arlington.

// Any unauthorized use of the RTOS without the consent of Dr. Jason Losh is a voilation of Copyright. // The RTOS here is designed to run in an premptive mode for TM4c123GH microcontroller. The published RTOS was later used for the second half of the project in the same course (EE 6314).

The startup.ccs file is not uploaded. An important change is required in that file as the function declaration of Interrrupt routines should be changed according to the name given in the code.
